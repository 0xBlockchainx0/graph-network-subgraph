A subgraph for the Graph Explorer, which only interacts with the GNS. Only running on Ganache right now for testing. 

Run the `setup.js` file in the `/scripts` folder. This will setup the the Graph Network contracts on the ganache testnet. 

Note that right now you need to reset the graph node and ganache, and drop and create the db in order to test again, everytime you want to test. 
 
A better solution will be made in the future that streamlines this process.
